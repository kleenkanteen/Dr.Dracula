 GENERAL CHEMISTRY 
Glucose Fasting

4.3-6.4
HbA1C

<6.0
Screening: Normal glycemic control
Goal for monitoring Non-Diabetics refer to OAML communique dated May 2015, Available on request
Creatinine
87
umol/L
50-115
eGFR
108
>=90
Normal eGFR is described as greater than or equal to 90 ml/min/1.73m^2
For patients of African descent, the reported eGFR must be multiplied by 1.15
Effective July 21, 2015, eGFR is calculated using the CKD-EPI 2009 equation
KDIGO 2012 guidelines highlighted the importance of eGFR and urine albumin creatinine ratio(ACR)in
screening, diagnosis and management of CKD. Result for eGFR should be interpreted in concert with ACR

Alk Phosphatase

Alkaline Phosphatase testing should be reserved for specific diagnosis, especially hepatobiliary and bone
disorders. Its use in routine health screening is not appropriate.

NON-HDL Choleste
3.81
mmol/L
Non-HDL cholesterol is calculated from total cholesterol and HDL-C and is not significanlty affected by the
fasting status of the patient
overnight fasting and early morning testing no longer needed for many lipid screening tests

LIPID TARGET VALUES
10 years CVD risk         Primary Tx Target        Alrenate Tx Target
________________________________________________________________________
High or intermediate     LDL <= 2.0 mmol/L or  Non-HDL-C <= 2.6 mmol/L
   (FRS>=10%)               >=50% decrease in LDL-C
Low(FRS<10%)                >=50% decrease in LDL-C
Chol/HDL-C is not included in the 2012 CCS guidelines as a lipid initiation or treatment target but is
recognized as an indicator of high CVD risk at Chol/HDL-C ratio>6.0

Asymptomatic patients should generally not be screened for thyroid disease (exceptions include pregnant,
post-partum, or post-menopausal women).  Thyroid function in patients with suspected thyroid disease is
best assessed with TSH as the sole screening test.  It is not appropriate to order free-T4 and/or free-T3 in
addition to TSH in the initial screen.
