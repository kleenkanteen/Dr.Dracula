Potassium Test
Potassium is an essential nutrient found throughout the body and is necessary for healthy cell activity.
A potassium test measures the amount of potassium in a blood or urine sample.
Potassium tests are used for diagnosis, monitoring, and screening of various health conditions.
High potassium levels (hyperkalemia) can be caused by dehydration, certain medications, or kidney problems.
Low potassium levels (hypokalemia) can be caused by diarrhea, vomiting, or diuretic medications.

Alkaline Phosphatase (ALP) Test
Alkaline phosphatase (ALP) is an enzyme found in the liver, bones, and other tissues.
An ALP test measures the level of ALP in the blood.
ALP tests are used for diagnosis, monitoring, and screening of liver and bone diseases.
High ALP levels can be caused by liver damage, bone problems, or other conditions.
Low ALP levels are less common but can occur due to malnutrition, nutrient deficiencies, or certain medical conditions.
